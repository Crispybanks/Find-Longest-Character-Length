# Find-longest-character-length
Find the longest character length in an array.

This is a simple C program I created for my personal benefit to learn C. I developed a function that finds the largest character in a string. For example, consider the array: `char *names[] = {"Luca", "Noah", "Theodore", "Remi", "Harper", "Avery", "Charlotte"};` With this program, you no longer need to manually count an index in the array; instead, you can compile your program and instantly obtain the result. I'm unsure if there are workarounds in C specifically designed for this purpose, but I developed this solution independently, which feels like an accomplishment.
